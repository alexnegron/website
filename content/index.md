##  I think about thinking.  ðŸ’­

I'm curious about principles underlying natural and artificial intelligence. I aim to explore them mathematically and illustrate them with computational tools. 

My interests live in the convex hull of the following areas: 
- Probability theory and statistics;
- Dynamical systems and partial differential equations
- Statistical physics of complex biological systems;
- Computational neuroscience and the mathematical theory of machine learning.

Academic: 
- ðŸ”— Summaries of research projects are [[Research/index|here]] 
- ðŸ”— My C.V. is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WTWcFU5vJWDjFOT-6Icvk9_eK4qhlN3C/view?usp=sharing) 


Currently, I am a [K. Lisa Yang Post-baccalaureate Research Scholar](https://bcs.mit.edu/postbac1) at MIT in the Brain and Cognitive Sciences department, advised by [Ila Fiete](https://fietelab.mit.edu).  

Previously, I was a [Simons Foundation Shenoy Undergraduate Research Fellow](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/grant/shenoy-undergraduate-research-fellowship-neuroscience-surfin/) at the University of Chicago, advised by [Brent Doiron](https://brainmath.bsd.uchicago.edu).



ðŸš§ This site hosts my academic work, but I intend to write about other things too. Stay tuned. ðŸš§
