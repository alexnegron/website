##  I think about thinking.  ðŸ’­

I'm curious about principles underlying natural and artificial intelligence. I aim to explore them mathematically and illustrate them with computational tools. 

My interests live in the convex hull of the following areas: 
- Probability theory and statistics;
- Dynamical systems and partial differential equations
- Statistical physics of complex biological systems;
- Computational neuroscience and the mathematical theory of machine learning.


Currently, I am a [K. Lisa Yang Post-baccalaureate Research Scholar](https://bcs.mit.edu/postbac1) at MIT in the Brain and Cognitive Sciences department, advised by [Ila Fiete](https://fietelab.mit.edu).  


- Previously, I was a [Simons Collaboration on the Global Brain](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/collaborations/global-brain/) Undergraduate Research Fellow at the University of Chicago, advised by [Brent Doiron](https://brainmath.bsd.uchicago.edu).
- You can find summaries of the research projects I've been a part of [[Research/index|here]]. 


Notes, thoughts, and creative works.
